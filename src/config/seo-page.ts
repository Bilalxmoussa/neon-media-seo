        "Search engine optimization is the most cost-effective marketing channel for Ottawa businesses. Unlike paid advertising where you pay for every click, SEO delivers compounding returns — the work you invest today continues to drive traffic and leads for months and years to come.",
        "Consider this: 93% of online experiences begin with a search engine, and 75% of users never scroll past the first page of Google. If your Ottawa business isn't visible in search results for your key services and products, you're invisible to the vast majority of potential customers who are actively looking for what you offer.",
        "Ottawa's business landscape is increasingly competitive online. Businesses that invest in SEO consistently outperform competitors who rely solely on word of mouth, social media, or paid advertising. SEO builds sustainable, long-term visibility that becomes your most reliable source of new customers.",

This includes analyzing your website's technical health, content quality, backlink profile, local citations, Google Business Profile, and competitive landscape. The audit identifies exactly where the biggest opportunities are for your specific business.",
        "From the audit, we develop a custom SEO strategy tailored to your industry, target keywords, and business goals. This isn't a one-size-fits-all approach — a dental practice in Kanata needs a different strategy than an e-commerce store in downtown Ottawa. Your strategy includes specific actions, timelines, and expected outcomes.",
        "Execution includes on-page optimization (title tags, meta descriptions, content, schema markup), technical SEO (site speed, mobile optimization, crawlability), content creation (blog posts, service pages, location pages), and off-page SEO (link building, citations, review strategy). We handle everything while keeping you informed with monthly progress reports.",

        "We've helped dozens of Ottawa businesses achieve top-3 rankings in the Local Pack for their most valuable keywords. From 'dentist Ottawa' to 'plumber Kanata' to 'web design Ottawa,' our local SEO strategies deliver measurable results that translate directly to new customers and revenue.",

      question: "How long does SEO take to show results?",
      answer:
        "SEO is a long-term strategy. Most Ottawa businesses start seeing meaningful improvements in rankings and traffic within 3-6 months, with significant results by 6-12 months. The timeline depends on your industry's competitiveness, current website authority, and the aggressiveness of your strategy.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does SEO cost in Ottawa?",
      answer:
        "Our SEO packages start at $799/month for local SEO and range up to $2,999/month for comprehensive SEO campaigns. The right investment depends on your industry, competition level, and growth goals. Every package includes measurable KPIs so you can track ROI.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you guarantee first-page rankings?",
      answer:
        "No reputable SEO agency can guarantee specific rankings because Google's algorithm considers hundreds of factors. What we do guarantee is a proven, transparent process, consistent effort, and measurable progress. Our track record speaks for itself — we've achieved first-page rankings for the vast majority of our Ottawa clients.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between SEO and paid advertising?",
      answer:
        "Paid advertising (Google Ads) delivers immediate visibility but stops the moment you stop paying. SEO takes longer to show results but delivers compounding returns — the traffic and rankings you build continue to generate leads long after the initial investment. Most successful Ottawa businesses use both.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a new website for SEO to work?",
      answer:
        "Not necessarily. If your current website is reasonably modern, mobile-responsive, and fast-loading, we can optimize it for SEO. However, if your site has fundamental technical issues, a redesign combined with SEO produces dramatically better results.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure SEO success?",
      answer:
        "We track keyword rankings, organic traffic, leads generated from organic search, conversion rates, and ROI. Every client receives monthly reports with clear metrics showing exactly how SEO is impacting their business. We focus on metrics that matter to your bottom line, not vanity metrics.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with Google Business Profile optimization?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Google Business Profile optimization is a core component of every local SEO package. We optimize your profile, manage posts, respond to reviews, and ensure your profile is working as hard as possible to drive local visibility and customer inquiries.",
